  "People are getting 'burned out' — collapsing from overwork. This concept doesn't exist in the Divan. Here you either work or get executed.",
  "There's a board game called 'Catan' — you gather resources, build roads. The Ottomans did the same thing for real. And it was version 1.0.",
  "There's still war in Palestine. There was in Ottoman times too. Some things don't change, Pasha.",
  "AI is drawing pictures. A painter sued saying 'they copied me.' The court didn't understand. They should have asked the Executioner — he'd have solved it more practically.",
